## Express and Mongo DB

- Start a new repo for a back end.

- your back end server should do the following:

- Have Express and mongoose installed

- listen to routes using express router (like we did in class)

- have at least one route that inserts data into your mongo DB

- have at least one route that fetches data from mongo db and returns it to the entity making the network request.
